## Setup

1. install packages in root, `/client` and `/server` directories with `npm setup` at the root `package.json`
2. create a`.env` file in `./client` and copy the contents of `.env.example` to it
3. if using `devbox`, run `devbox services up` to run both server and client, else manually startup the server and client with their provided `npm` scripts
